<h4 style="color:HotPink;">HELLO!!</h4>
<h4>i'm mr oli <a class="shakeh" href="https://pronouns.page/@olicauli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[20 he/him]</a>!</h4>
<p>i'm just a directionless little SE student who thought making a funky personal website would be fun. 
  i like videos games, coding, languages, and many other things; my interests tend to jump around a lot and last like.
  two weeks max, but when i have a interest i will pretty much talk non-stop about it! i made this website on one of those interest binges 
because the idea of making my own little early 2000s themed home sounded super fun.</p>
<h4 style="color:HotPink;">goals for the site</h4>
<p style="color:Gold;">- to get better at programming in a variety of languages,</p>
<p style="color:Gold;">- to have a place to dump all the stuff i make</p>
<p style="color:Gold;">- to have fun
<p>i've never really made anything like this before--all
  my previous html/css experience was making boring modern pages like 4 years ago on codecademy--so this is very much
  a learning process for me. expect a lot of fixes and updates (for the next few weeks atleast).</p>
<h4>~-*-~</h4>
<h4>i hope you enjoy my website!</h4>
