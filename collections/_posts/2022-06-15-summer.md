i live! <i class="frogbounce"></i> <i class="frogbounce"></i>

last semester was certainly Something. focused on my schedule rather than making sure i got decent professors and ended up getting bad professors, which was super stressful but it's all ended well. unfortunately tho due to the 5-6 months of inactivity its taking me a hot minute to remember what i was doing here NJKWAGNJKGWANJ. i'm taking summer pretty easy; mostly just been getting driving practice and lightly studying my mandarin.

there are a few things i wanna do--coming back to this website, the file directory is still kind of a mess, and site updatelog updates are all in one file which i format manually. i'll probably try and wrestle jekyll into organizing these things, and then maybe start working on a little phaserjs or twine game, or make a few little widgets in js for practice.

BTW，我打针"T"了！🎉🎉🎉

that's pretty much all i have to update on. 再见！
