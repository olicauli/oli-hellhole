welcome to the new journals!! now all the entries are collapsible (if you have javascript enabled)!!

also, i Finally refactored the journal page so that everything wasn't in one file. i considered giving every entry their own page, 
but i didn't like it very much, so we are still havin everything on one page >:)

unfortunately, thru all this site making the file directory for it has become a bit of a mess wajkngjkwagaw. 
it's bugging me and i wanna fix it (and also make the site not break every time i change the file structure), 
but i'd have to put in some time figuring out jekyll permalink stuff. while i'm sure it's p easy i wanna put 
in some time working on my discord bot first. so much to do, so little time...
