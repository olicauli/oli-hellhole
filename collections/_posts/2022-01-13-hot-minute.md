<p>yoooooooo!!!</p>
<p>it's been a hot minute!</p>
<p>sorry for not updating for a little while. basically, for a little while i took a break to just play video games 
   and stuff. then, during a dnd campaign, i noticed that my dm was struggling with worldanvil, and while helping
   them figure stuff out i kept thinking "god... if i did this and this i could improve this site," which
   then got me thinking that creating my own little world creation website would be really fun. so, i decided to
   try and pick up react.js, only to learn that web development is, in fact, an entirely new skillset for me to
   learn, and to properly make this project i would need to devote some real time into learning stuff like AJAX,
   how to use an API, how to use a database language like SQL, etc. THEN i got very excited about making an interactive shopping list
   and got completely distracted making a discord bot.</p>
<p><span>pros:</span> i now have a discord bot! i added a link to its source code in <a href="{% link projects.html %}">projects</a>.
         it does literally nothing right now ajnwgnjkawjnkgawa. also since i was using a javascript library for the discord bot i feel a lot 
         more confident writing in javascript</p>
<p><span>cons:</span> <span style="color:DarkSeaGreen" class="frogs">My Waking Life Has Been Consumed by making a discord bot</span></p>
<p>anyways coming back and looking at all this text crammed into one file is making me cry. once my brain
      unfixates itself i swear im gonna come back and refactor all the blogs >:)</p>
