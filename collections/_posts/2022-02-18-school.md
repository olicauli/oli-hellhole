hello!! it's been a while. like an entire month, actually!

aarrghhh ive been busy. the reason for the long absense is pretty much just college. this semester i've taken a lot of homework-heavy courses, so when i don't have homework i don't really have the brainpower to do much else. unfortunately this means a lot of my hobbies have basically been sidelined T_T

i've been hoping that as the semester continues things will calm down enough that i'll be able to spend more time on my hobbies, but so far that doesn't seem to be the case lol.

the good news is that i finally decided to get back to practicing my mandarin after several months of procrastinating! so in addition to this journal i've added an entry to the mandarin journal. expect it to be kind of basic; while i've been learning mandarin on and off for like a year, it's been veeery on and off, so i'm still pretty much a beginner.

see you again (hopefully in less than a month's time, lol!!) <i class="heartbounce"></i>
