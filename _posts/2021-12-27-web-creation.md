<p>waaarrghgh!! today i have a Lot of feelings. this website is kind of making me feel
   an unhealthy amount of excitement!! get ready for a completely unedited word-vomit
   of all my feelings!! (edit: unfortunately this is no longer true lmao. after i left
   my manic excited state some parts of the journal made me feel embarassed so i removed them)</p>
        
<p>first of all, i found out that retro-style live chat boxes still exist. for most of the 
   old late 2000s early 2010s stuff, i kinda figured that the companies hosting them would
   try to rebrand and maybe die out. i'm so so happy i'm wrong! having a little chat box on here makes me just unbelievably happy.</p>

<p>second of all, i never really thought i could have so much fun making a website.
   i've been a little bit super fixated on getting this site set up, but now that everything's been mostly added i'm hoping my 
   brain calms down a bit so i can get some more productive stuff done. until then, expect a lot of
   activity from me lol.</p>

<p>i guess there's also something else i realised (or rather, re-remembered) from making this... i have 
   No Idea how to talk to people.</p> 
   <p>i just!! have no clue how small talk works!!! what do normal people write on guestbooks?? 
      what's socially appropriate to say to strangers??? i'm still gonna try regardless, but DAMN lol. 
      it kinda hit me all at once.
   <p>that's all for today! expect other journal entries to be a bit shorter than this.</p>
