<p>hello! it's been a few days! ya man got hit by a bit of a depressive episode but i think 
   i am doing a bit better today.</p>
<p>winter break is ending in only a few weeks from now, so i'm getting hit with a bit of the 
   "i have done absolutely nothing useful with my time" guilt awjkngkjwaga. :(</p>
<p>i also learned something about myself: i actually can't really stand from-the-ground-up coding tutorials,
   they r very boring. as a result, learning js has been 
   a bit of a difficult slog, but now that i've realised that these tutorials aren't meeting my 
   needs and that more learn-by-doing "just skim through the reference docs until you have what you need 
   and fix it later" kind of stuff is better for me, i might make a bit more progress.</p>
<p>for now, behold the only fruit of my labour! (if u have js enabled anyway):</p>
<p class="collapsible">behold frog</p>
<div class="collapse_content">
   <img class="shake" src="{% link assets/images/drfrg.gif %}">
   <p class="shake">bow before his majesty</p>
</div>
<p>i guess the only other thing is that the blog pages are a bit of a mess;
   what i'll work on for now is making em a little dynamic so that there isnt Every Single Blogpost
   on one page. maybe make each date a button that expands the page content</p>
