<p>PHEW.... i've done pretty much nothing but draw stuff for the new navbar and
rewrite all my code today. i did not intend to learn liquid but. i guess i know liquid now??</p>
<p>the drawing stuff wasn't exactly planned, but since i'm probably going to be making
assets for this site + basic games in js or other languages to practice, i figured
having a good sprite-making program was a good idea, and i heard asesprite was good and it was like 
$12 dollars, so i bought it. then i realised that i could make gifs in it, so i got kinda absorbed 
in doing that, and it all went downhill from there. steam says i somehow spent 9 hours in asesprite today???</p>
<p>as for the refactoring, although it was time consuming, i'm pretty thankful i put the time into getting it done! it's
going to be far far easier making new pages without having to copy and paste and edit and fix
all that repeated code. i also learned a few new css thingies, like the ::before and ::after pseudoclasses,
which was super super cool, because i like having gifs before and after things! and now i can do that 
in a much more readable way <i class="frogbounce"></i></p>
<p>here are a few of the resources i used, if anyone was curious:</p>
<p>the static site generator: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">jekyll documentation</a></p>
<p>the template language jekyll uses to generate pages: <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/">
  liquid documentation</a></p>
<p>anyway, that's it for now. i kinda wanna practice my mandarin more, so hopefully i'll add an entry to 
中文日记 soon. look forward to my absolutely garbage mandarin!!</p>
