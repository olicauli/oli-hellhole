<h4>2021年12月25日</h4>
<p>MERRY CHRISTMAS!!</p>
<p>thoughts on endwalker: it is excellent. it's actually so excellent it's kind of a problem; before i
   started hyperfixating on making this site, i was pretty much
   playing it non-stop over the break without doing anything productive. it was kind of a problem because
   i <i>did</i> want to take more time to learn JS over the break (since i somehow havent learnt it yet??
   kind of impressive for someone who's been doing cs related stuff for like. 3-4 years at this point)</p>
<p>anyway, i've beaten both extreme trials and even though the process was frustrating,
   i do kinda like the bragging rights, even if we didnt get a single couerl.</p>
<p>the new raid series is fun! i particularly like the music for both the main area and the raid instances.
   themis is very cool and i want to ruffle his hair.</p>
<p>this is all for now. merry christmas!</p>
