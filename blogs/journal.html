<h4 style="color:HotPink;"> hello! </h4>
<p>welcome to my journal! i likely won't update super often, but every now and then i'll add an entry.
   this will mostly be a space to kind of catalogue my feelings and talk about my current interests.</p>

<p>PHEW.... i've done pretty much nothing but draw stuff for the new navbar and
rewrite all my code today. i did not intend to learn liquid but. i guess i know liquid now??</p>
<p>the drawing stuff wasn't exactly planned, but since i'm probably going to be making
assets for this site + basic games in js or other languages to practice, i figured
having a good sprite-making program was a good idea, and i heard asesprite was good and it was like 
$12 dollars, so i bought it. then i realised that i could make gifs in it, so i got kinda absorbed 
in doing that, and it all went downhill from there. steam says i somehow spent 9 hours in asesprite today???</p>
<p>as for the refactoring, although it was time consuming, i'm pretty thankful i put the time into getting it done! it's
going to be far far easier making new pages without having to copy and paste and edit and fix
all that repeated code. i also learned a few new css thingies, like the ::before and ::after pseudoclasses,
which was super super cool, because i like having gifs before and after things! and now i can do that 
in a much more readable way <i class="frogbounce"></i></p>
<p>here are a few of the resources i used, if anyone was curious:</p>
<p>the static site generator: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">jekyll documentation</a></p>
<p>the template language jekyll uses to generate pages: <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/">
  liquid documentation</a></p>
<p>anyway, that's it for now. i kinda wanna practice my mandarin more, so hopefully i'll add an entry to 
中文日记 soon. look forward to my absolutely garbage mandarin!!</p>

<p>waaarrghgh!! today i have a Lot of feelings. this website is kind of making me feel
   an unhealthy amount of excitement!! get ready for a completely unedited word-vomit
   of all my feelings!!</p>
        
<p>first of all, i found out that retro-style live chat boxes still exist. for most of the 
   old late 2000s early 2010s stuff, i kinda figured that the companies hosting them would
   try to rebrand and maybe die out. i'm so so happy i'm wrong! having a little chat box on here makes me just unbelievably happy.</p>
        
<img src="{% link resources/images/drfrg.gif %}">
        
<p>second of all, i never really thought i could have so much fun making a website.
   i've been a little bit super fixated on getting this site set up, but now that everything's been mostly added i'm hoping my 
   brain calms down a bit so i can get some more productive stuff done. until then, expect a lot of
   activity from me lol.</p>

<p>i guess there's also something else i realised (or rather, re-remembered) from making this... i have 
   No Idea how to talk to people.</p> 
   <p>i just!! have no clue how small talk works!!! what do normal people write on guestbooks?? 
      what's socially appropriate to say to strangers??? i'm still gonna try regardless, but DAMN lol. 
      it kinda hit me all at once.
   <p>that's all for today! expect other journal entries to be a bit shorter than this.</p>
