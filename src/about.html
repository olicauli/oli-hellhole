<!--
<p>i'm a SE student who thought making a funky personal website would be fun. 
  i like videos games, coding, languages, and many other things; my interests tend to jump around a lot and last like.
  two weeks max, but when i have a interest i will pretty much talk non-stop about it! i made this website on one of those interest binges 
because the idea of making my own little early 2000s themed home sounded super fun.</p>
-->

<!-- 
<p>i've never really made anything like this before--all
  my previous html/css experience was a bunch of stuff i forgot like 4 years ago on codecademy, so this is very much
  a learning process for me. expect a lot of fixes and updates.</p>
