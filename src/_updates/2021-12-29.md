* new navbar icons!
* new webbutton!
* new favicon!
* new homemade gifs!
* refactored almost everything -- every html page except bonpyre now 
uses a static site generator (jekyll), which will
make changes much easier to implement in the future
since i will not have to repeat as much code.
* this also means i now know a bunch of Liquid. neat!
* style.css is now a monster!
